# # Firms' Short-Run Decisions to Produce and Long-Run Decisions to Enter or Exit a Market

# ## Short-Run Decisions
# 
# 1. The **shut-down rule** states that firms should not produce when **price falls below AVC**. The more produced, the greater loss.
# 1. When P > AVC, a firm should continue to produce as long as MR > MC up to the level of output at which MR = MC; the profit is maximized.
# 1. When P > AVC but P < ATC, a firm should continue to produce until MR = MC where the total loss is minimized.

# > The figure below shows **loss minimization**.

# ```{tip}
# For convenience, MC can be taken as a short-run **supply** curve and MR can be taken as a **demand** curve.
# ```

# ## Long-Run Decisions

# Whether to enter or leave depends on the **economic profit**.
# - In a perfect competition market, firms have no barrier to entry or exit.
# - When the firms can earn economic profits, they will enter.
# - Profits will attract new competition and firms, while losses create incentives to leave the market.
