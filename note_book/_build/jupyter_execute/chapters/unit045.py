# # Oligopoly and Game Theory

# Oligopoly
# : A very small number of firms have market dominance (less than 10).
# : Firms use strategic pricing (**price interdependence**).
# 
# Features of oligopoly:
# - A few large producers
# - Identical or differentiated products
# - High barriers to entry
# - Control over price (price maker)
# - Collusion

# Collusion
# : An agreement (usually illegal) is drawn up to agree on what price and quantity will be produced in a market.
# : e.g. OPEC, also called **cartel** (a groups of firms acting together and not to compete).
