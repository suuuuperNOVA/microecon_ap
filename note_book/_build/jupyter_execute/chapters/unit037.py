# # Perfect Competition

# Perfect competition exists when there are a large number of sellers competing in the market.
# - Many small firms;
# - Firms can easily enter and exit;
# - Firms are price takers, having no influencing on the price of product they produce;
# - Identical products (perfect substitutes);
# - Price is determined by the market.
# 
# That's why it's a horizontal line on the firm graph.<br>
# In a perfect competition market, a firm has a **perfectly elastic demand curve** (Marginal Revenue = Demand = Average Revenue = Price).

# ## Efficiency
# 
# Efficiency
# : Optimal use of scarce resources.
# 
# - Perfect competition forces producers to use limited resources to their fullest.
# - Inefficient firms have higher costs and are the first to leave the industry.
# - Perfectly competitive industries are extremely efficient.
# 
# There are 2 kinds of efficiency.
# - Productive efficiency
#     - Producing at the lowest possible cost;
#     - At the minimum point of ATC;
#     - At the point where Price Curve intersects MC and touches the minimum point of ATC;
#     - Attainable in the **long run** (**Long-Run Equilibrium**).
# - Allocative efficiency
#     - Producing at the amount most desired by society;
#     - At the point where MC = MR;
#     - Attainable in the short run.

# ## Long-Run Market Equilibrium
# 
# Long-Run market equilibrium
# : A market is in long-run market equilibrium when the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded, given that sufficient time has elapsed for entry into and exit from the industry to occur.
# 
# > Here is an example.<br> 
# > Suppose there is an increase in demand.
# 
# **In the short run**
# - The price increased from P1 to P2.
# - The new MR/D/AR/P2 curve intersected MC at a new profit-maximizing point (where the new profit-maximizing quantity = qf2). Also, called **allocative efficiency**.
# - The new price was above ATC when Q = qf2, creating the economic profit in the short run.

# **In the long run**
# - When firms found there were positive economic profits, they entered the industry, shifting the market supply curve to the right.
# - The price dropped and the economic profit became 0 (**normal profit**).
# - The rest firms produced at **productive efficiency** where **ATC = P3**.
# - Firms only made accounting profits.

# Firms may have 3 different long-run industry supply curves.
# - In an increasing-cost industry, the LR supply curve is upward sloping.
# - In a constant-cost industry, the LR supply curve is horizontal (perfectly elastic).
#     - The cost is not effected by changes in the size of industry.
# - In a decreasing-cost industry, the LR supply curve is downward sloping.
