# # Perfect Competition

# Perfect competition exists when there are a large number of sellers competing in the market.
# - Firms can easily enter and exit;
# - Firms are price takers, having no influencing on the price of product they produce;
# - Identical products;
# - Price is determined by the market.
# 
# That's why it's a horizontal line on the firm graph.<br>
# In a perfect competition market, a firm has a **perfectly elastic demand curve** (Marginal Revenue = Demand = Average Revenue = Price).
