# # Monopsonistic Markets

# > Similar to a monopoly.
# 
# Monopsony
# : Single buyer of labor.
# : e.g. small-town coal mine.

# A monopsony has 2 **upward-sloping** curves, S and MFC. The MFC curve increases at a faster rate than the supply curve because:
# 1. Firm must pay higher wages to hire additional workers;
# 1. Firm cannot wage discriminate, pay every worker same.

# The figure below shows the quantity of labor hired in a monopsonistic labor market would be <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
