# # Types of Profit

# There are 2 types of profit, **accounting profit** and **economic profit**.<br>
# 
# Accounting profit
# : Business's total revenue minus the explicit cost and depreciation.<br><br>
# 
# Economic profit
# : Buinessâ€™s total revenue minus the opportunity cost of its resources.
# : Opportunity Cost = Explicit Cost + Implicit Cost
# : Usually, accounting profit > economic profit<br><br>
# : When the **economic profit is positive**, the business owner could be better off financially if he/she continued to operate the business.<br><br>
# : When the **economic profit is negative** , the business owner could be better off financially if he/she closed the business and devoted his/her time and capital to something else. It means there is a better alternative use for resources.<br><br>

# Normal profit
# : When economic profit = 0.
# : The firm cannot do any better using its resources in any alternative activity.
