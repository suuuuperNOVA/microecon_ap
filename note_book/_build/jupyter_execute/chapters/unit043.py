# # Price Discrimination

# Price discrimination
# : Practice of selling the same products to different buyers at different prices.
# : e.g. airline tickets<br><br>
# : Price discrimination seeks to charge each consumer what they are willing to pay in an effort to increase profits.

# Conditions of price discrimination:
# - Must have monopoly power;
# - Able to segregate the market or perfect information about each consumer;
# - Consumers must **not** be able to resell the product.

# ## Monopoly with Perfect Price Discrimination

# A perfectly discrimination can charge each person differently, so **MR = Demand**.

# - No consumer surplus<br>Eevery consumer is paying the highest price.
# - Profits increase
# - No deadweight loss
