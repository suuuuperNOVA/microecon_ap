# # Monopolistic Competition

# Monopolistic competition
# : Monopoly + Perfect Competition
# : Firms are monopolies in the sense that they sell their own products.
# 
# Features of monopolistic competition:
# - Relatively large number of sellers
# - Differentiated products
# - Some control over price
# - Easy entry and exit (low barriers)
# - More non-price competition (ads).

# ```{note}
# Monopolistic qualities
# - Price maker of own goods due to differentiated products;
# - D is greater than MR;
# - Not efficient, neither allocatively nor productively.
# 
# Perfect competition qualities
# - Large number of smaller firms;
# - Relatively easy entry and exit;
# - Normal profit in the long run.
# ```

# ## Graphs of Monopolistic Competition

# ### In the Short Run

# - In the short run, the figure is the exactly same as monopoly in which the grey area is the economic profits.
# - If monopolistically competitive firms are earning profits, new firms will eventually enter the industry, decreasing the demand (shifting to left).
# - If firms are incurring losses, some firms will leave, increasing the demand (shifting to right).

# ### In the Long Run

# In the long run, there is no economic profit and firms produces at the point where ATC is **tengent** with D before its minimum point.

# ## Is Monopolistic Competition Efficient?
# 
# - **Not** Allocatively efficient<br>The quantity produced is less than the market demanded.
# <br><br>
# - **Not** Productively efficient<br>Not produce at the minimum point on ATC.

# ### Excess Capacity

# Excess capacity
# : Gap between minimum ATC output and the profit maximizing output.<br><br>
# : Given current resources, the firm can produce at the lowest costs (minimum ATC) but they decide not to.
