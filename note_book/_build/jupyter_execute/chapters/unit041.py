# # Introduction to Imperfectly Competitive Markets

# ```{admonition} Perfect vs. Imperfect Competition
# 
# - Perfectly competitive firms are **price takers**, so the demand curve is constant and equal to MR.
# - Imperfectly competitive firms are **price makers**, so they have downward sloping demand curves.
#     - MR is **not** equal to the demand;
#     - Firm must lower price to sell additional units.
