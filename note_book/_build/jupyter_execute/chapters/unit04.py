# An imperfectly competitive market exists because of high **barriers** to keep other firms from entering. Incentives to enter an industry may be mitigated by **barriers** to entry.

# Types of barriers to entry:
# - High fixed/start-up costs
# - Geography
# - Ownership of raw materials
# - Legal barriers.
