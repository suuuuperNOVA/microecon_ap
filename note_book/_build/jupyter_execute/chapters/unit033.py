# # Long-Run Production Costs

# > In the **long-run**, **all** resources are variable. For example, the size and capacity of the factory can change.<br><br>The long-run production cost is used for planning for firms to identify which size factory results in the lowest per unit cost.

# The figure below shows how the ATC curves change within 5 different short-run plant sizes.

# A long-run average total cost (LRATC) curve is a U shape connecting the bottom or minimum ATCs of the 5 curves.<br>
# 
# Long-run average total cost curve/LRATC
# : Relationship between output and average total cost when fixed cost has been chosen to minimize average total cost for each level of output.

# ## Stages of the Long-Run Average Total Cost Curve
# 
# **Economies of scale**
# - Occur when the LRATC curve decreases as output increases.
# - Also mean **increasing returns to scale**,<br>where if inputs are increased by X%, output increases more than X%.

# **Constant returns to scale**
# - Occur when the LRATC curve remains constant as production increases.
# - When output increases directly in proportion to an increase in all inputs.
# - Where if inputs are increased by X%, output increases by X%.

# **Diseconomies of scale**
# - Occur when the LRATC curve increases as a firm's output increases.
# - Also mean **decreasing returns to scale**,<br>where if inputs are increased by X%, output increases less than X%.
